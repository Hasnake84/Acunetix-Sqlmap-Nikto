# Project: Unveiling Vulnerabilities in a Demo Web Application
In this project i have learned how to deploy these web application testing tools such as Acunetix enterprise edition to the following free open source tools, Sqlmap and Nikto for identifying vulnerabilities that are listed on OWASP Top 10. It's important to note that web application testing tools are just one part of a comprehensive web security strategy. Other security practices, such as code reviews, penetration testing, and regular security updates, are also essential for protecting web applications from attacks.

<b>Acunetix:</b> This automated scanner will be deployed to comprehensively assess the web application for vulnerabilities. Acunetix will meticulously crawl the application, pinpoint injection points, and attempt diverse exploitation methods to uncover SQL injection weaknesses and a broader range of security gaps.

<b>Sqlmap:</b> To delve deeper into SQL injection vulnerabilities, sqlmap will be employed. This potent tool allows for crafting and injecting intricate SQL queries by hand. sqlmap will then attempt to extract sensitive information, escalate privileges, and potentially gain unauthorized access to the underlying database, providing a thorough analysis of SQL injection risks.

<b>Nikto:</b> This web server scanner will be used to meticulously scrutinize the web server's configuration and installed components for vulnerabilities. Nikto will be on the lookout for outdated software versions, misconfigured files, and potentially exploitable scripts, uncovering weaknesses beyond SQL injection and directory traversal.

By strategically integrating these tools and techniques, this project will provide a holistic assessment of a web application's security posture. It will expose a wider range of vulnerabilities, going beyond the initial focus of SQL injection and directory traversal.  This comprehensive analysis will be instrumental in fortifying the application's defenses and mitigating the risk of various cyberattacks.
